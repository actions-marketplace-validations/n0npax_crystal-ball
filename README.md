# Crystal Ball

Github action to react on dummy issues report.

## Why?

More or less often we are expecting issues which are not actionable.

Empty issue body is an example of unactionable issue.
Simillarly if issue template with checklist is given but no field is selected, it's possible to consider an issue as not ready to be triaged.

The `Crystal Ball` action will check issue description and respond to it base on predefined checks or customer provided regular expressions
